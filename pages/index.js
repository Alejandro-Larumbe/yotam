            <p>
              Israel-born Yotam Levy started playing the cello under the
              tutelage of Susan Berman, prior to coming to New Zealand in 2003.
              He subsequently carried on his studies with Martin Griffiths for
              six years, and later graduated from the University of Waikato with
              a Bachelor of Music in cello performance. His musical activities
              are many and varied - a balance of teaching with an extensive
              involvement in a diverse stream of projects locally, from
              orchestral playing to chamber music; recording; multiple
              collaborations with local composers and artists, bringing new and
              original works to the performance stage.
